                        <p>Are you looking for a site for a gathering or a function that suits your needs the best? Spacefynd is all about spaces for everyone, you can either list your space in their database or look up for a suitable one from the many spaces available with them. Spacefynd makes it super comfortable and easy for people to find appropriate venues to hire either for a private or public gathering.</p>
                        <p>Do you want to list your venue in their database? Sign up for a profile, put up the pictures of the place, highlight its salient features and let it be hired by someone. If you are looking for a space for your event then search their database according to the type, city or number of people and they will filter the results for you. Contact the venue manager from your profile and once you are done with that, visit the venue for complete satisfaction before you pay. Liked the venue you chose? Start planning your event! You can start with your search all over again even if you didn’t like the one you chose before; they are always cool with that.</p>

                        <p>Spacefynd contacted Incubasys last year with the project to build a website for them with an automate development, database management and highly effective control panel that would cater best to the work they do. They required a catchy website that would go with their brand’s identity, would be easy to manage from the admin panel.
