                    <p>By <a href="blog-inner.php">AbuBakar Butt</a> Category <a href="blog-inner.php">News Posted</a> Date <em class="date">February 29, 2016</em></p>
                    <p>“Hey, let’s start a new company today!” said no one ever. The idea for a new business might come to you in the strangest of settings and time but you cannot simply launch a company the next day. Consumers do not pay for low quality services and they certainly do not want to buy from you if you don’t have your act together.</p>
                    <p>If you want to build a thriving business from the ground up, you cannot do it alone. You need a strong team of equally motivated people by your side.</p>
                    <h3>You are the key leader</h3>
                    <p>Since you are the one who presented the idea, you must shoulder most of the initial responsibilities until you find suitable team members to share them with you. Before you begin a venture, you have to understand how many people will be depending on you for direction. Do not proceed with your plan if you are unsure about seeing it till the end. You cannot lose sight of the finish line and leave others confused and disappointed.</p>
                    <h3>Don’t settle for anyone but the best</h3>
                    <p>It’s not difficult to post ads and contact people through job websites or talk to people you know who may refer appropriate individuals for your future team. However, hiring the best in the business often means wanting people who already have jobs they are satisfied with. In such cases, you will have to come up with incentives for them. Just because someone is unemployed does not mean that no one wanted them or that they are bad at their job. Treat all your candidates with complete impartiality.</p>
                    <h3>Identify Positions</h3>
                    <p>No organization can operate without an established hierarchy or command structure. This let’s everyone know their exact position in the company. By assigning tasks and putting limits, you will ensure that no one oversteps their bounds. Once every member on the team comprehends their responsibilities and acknowledges their superiors, things will run smoothly. It is important that you delegate tasks based on the strengths and weaknesses of each worker. This is part of your job as a high level manager.</p>
                    <h3>Team categories</h3>
                    <p>When you visualize your dream team, there will be categories you will place team members in according to their specific positions in your company. There will be professional advisors and consultants who show you the big picture and point out the little details you might have missed. Initially, it is advised to keep employees on a contract basis so that you may test them thoroughly but not depend on them so completely that your company suffers if they turn out to be the wrong one. As your profits rise you will probably feel the need to hire people on your fulltime staff. Those who have substantial claims or shares in your business might be eligible for partnerships.</p>
                    <h3>First employees are critical</h3>
                    <p>Don’t make the mistake of waiting too long to hire your first employee since realistically there only so much a single human being can handle. Don’t be afraid to lose some profit on their paycheck because the returns on this investment will be considerable. Find someone with skills you are in dire needs of to take your company forward. Reliability and efficiency are not to be compromised on when you hire your first employees.</p>
                    <h3>Invest in a good HR manager</h3>
                    <p>Without doubt the greatest asset of any company is its human resources. Hiring a professional HR manager to ensure that your employee’s needs are well met will keep them working at full efficiency. Additionally, you won’t have to deal with them personally if you don’t have the time or people skills to handle their situations.</p>
                    <h3>How to identify possible candidates?</h3>
                    <p>So you have a bunch of interested people, how do you do which ones will work well with you? They must possess enough experience to be competent in the position you wish to place them in. References from reliable sources are always welcome. Initially, they should be willing to negotiate on salary details. Belief in your business vision is critical so is motivation to make a difference in their field.</p>
                    <h3>Traits to prioritize candidates</h3>
                    <p>Here is a list of attributes a good candidate must have for any position within your company’s structure.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliability</li>
                        <li>Efficiency</li>
                        <li>Experience</li>
                        <li>Specialization</li>
                        <li>Required skill set</li>
                        <li>Sufficient education</li>
                        <li>Willingness to learn</li>
                        <li>Professional attitude</li>
                        <li>Team spirit</li>
                        <li>Good ethics</li>
                        <li>Confidence</li>
                        <li>Common sense</li>
                        <li>Ability to improvise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Interview chosen candidates</h3>
                    <p>After filtering through candidates, start the interview process. Try to find out as much as possible regarding anything that involves their job. Get a measure of why they want this job and how well they will perform it. Ask about their past career choices and future career plans.</p>
                    <h3>Thorough background checks</h3>
                    <p>Never skip this step because you don’t want to find out later that you have hired someone who was fired from their job because of disturbing reasons or has an unacceptable criminal record. Make a point to talk to their former employers and coworkers if possible.</p>
                    <h3>How many employees can you afford?</h3>
                    <p>Do not get carried away during the hiring process and forget how many employees you can actually afford to hire. Leave out the ones who are not urgently needed. Don’t just think about the present: Plan for the future.</p>
                    <h3>Integrate new recruits into your team</h3>
                    <p>Don’t just push a new team member to their workstation the first day and order them to start working immediately. Make an effort to make them feel welcome and familiarize them with the office environment and other coworkers. </p>
                    <h3>Post-Hire assessment</h3>
                    <p>Begin with minor tests and progress to more difficult tasks to test out your new recruit. This will help you determine if you made a mistake. If so, it is best to let them go. You don’t want sometime on your team who will jeopardize your chances at success and bring others down with them.</p>
                    <h3>Train and strategize</h3>
                    <p>Get your team together and involve them in the decision making processes. Take their feedback into consideration and take steps to enhance their skills. This is a great way to give them positive vibes about their workplace and bring in more profits for your business in the long term.</p>
                    <h3>Reach out to others</h3>
                    <p>Don’t just hide in your comfortable new corner in the market, move out of your comfort zone and meet your competitors and other relevant business owners. Build a good impression among your peers and build strong relationships for mutual benefit. Learn from their experiences and observe how they run their own companies.</p>
                    <h3>Go with the flow</h3>
                    <p>Things don’t always turn out the way you planned. Ups and downs in the market happen all the time. The biggest mistake you could make it stay stuck in your old ways rather than growing along with your business peers. If you deem it a good investment, then make it rather than remaining where you are while everyone moves forward without you.</p>
                    <h3>Stay realistic</h3>
                    <p>Do not blow up every time an employee fails to deliver exactly what you asked for or whenever a seemingly great investment turns to ashes right in front of you. Sometimes being the owner makes you forget the people working under you. You see only the big picture and fail to recognize the low level situation your employees face every day. You must teach yourself to have realistic expectations from your employees. Not only that, you should also make peace with the fact that you don’t have the power to change everything to your liking.</p>
                    <h3>Succeed</h3>
                    <p>Once you understand the intricacies of starting a business, hiring a reliable crew and working with them to reach your goals, you will see success close on the horizon.</p>
